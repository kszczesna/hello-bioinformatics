# Hello Bioinformatics

This repository contains a small demonstrative bioinformatics project
showing a basic RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow in Python.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in:
- working with tabular biological data
- basic quality checks and data inspection
- filtering significant genes
- log2 transformations
- data visualization (volcano plot)
- biological interpretation of results

## Project structure
- `hello_bioinformatics.ipynb` – main analysis notebook
- `volcano_plot.png` – visualization of differential expression results
- `environment.yml` – reproducible conda environment

## Tools & technologies
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
- conda

## Notes
This project uses simulated data for demonstration purposes,
but reflects a real-world RNA-seq analysis workflow used in industry.
